# simple-linear-regression

In this notebook, I build a linear regression model to predict Sales using an appropriate predictor variable.

Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data 
1. Importing data using the pandas library
2. Understanding the structure of the data

Step 2: Visualising the Data
visualise my data using seaborn.

Step 3: Performing Simple Linear Regression
Train-Test Split
Building a Linear Model

Step 4: Residual analysis
To validate assumptions of the model, and hence the reliability for inference

Step 5: Predictions on the Test Set
